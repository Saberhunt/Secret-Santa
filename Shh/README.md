Secret Santa Program

###############################################
<br>HOW TO USE:
1. Add the names of people who want to participate in the Secret Santa in the "names = [] " variable
2. Add the emails of the respective people in the "emails = [] " variable.  Make sure the emails correspond to the order in which the names are entered
3. Assign a price limit in the "pricelimit = '' " variable
4. A message is already pre-formated, which can be changed if so desired
5. Enter the email address you want to send the messages from in the "fromAdd = '' " variable
6. The "SecretSanta.jpg" is simply a fun image that I added for flavor.  It is optional to add it, or you can add a different image if so desired.  If no "SecretSanta.jpg" is found, it is simply skipped, and the rest of the code should run.
7. MAKE SURE YOU SET THE EMAIL SERVER YOU ARE USING.  It is defaulted to the Gmail server, but you will need to make sure your email will allow logins from unknown devices otherwise it will not work.  Specific instructions for other email servers should be available in their respective public documentations
8. You will also need to enter your email password, so the server can actually sign in.  IT WILL NOT WORK IF YOU HAVE 2-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ENABLED.
9. A confirmation message should print, which will confirm that an email was sent to each respective email
